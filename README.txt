OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (R)
Cleaning Raw Data

This tutorial has two objectives. The first objective is to demonstrate the
process of cleaning a raw data file from start to finish. The second objective
is to demonstrate some features of R which are critical for writing
efficient code and the syntax for a number of commands needed for data
cleaning. The tutorial concludes with a demonstration of how to reshape data
from long to wide format.

To run this tutorial you will need R Studio version 1.0 or higher. Download the
R cleaning_raw_data.zip file and unzip the contents into a folder on your Desktop.
Double-click to open the cleaning_raw_data_XX.Rmd file using R Studio. As you
see each grey section of code in the file viewer pane, click on the green arrow
to run the commands. You will see the results in the window below.
